# 🥖 La Baguette
## 📃 About This Mod
This mod implements the La Baguette item from the April Fool's snapshot. Rather than just scrapping the idea of having this item, I decided to bring it back to life.
## 📖 What's Inside?
As mentioned above, this mod brings back the La Baguette item. In the Minecraft April Fool's snapshot, the La Baguette item was also used as a wooden sword, having the same durability and tool material as one. Here are some statistics of the La Baguette item.

- Durability: 59
- Tool Material/Repair Material: Wooden Planks
- Hunger: 15
- Saturation: 15

*Yes, you can still eat the baguette even at 1 durability.*
